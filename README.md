# MyOwnREADME
Purpose: Each program goes through a list of if and for statements and completes each
task thouroughly.
Conclusion: I learned how to improve from what I already learned and added new skills
to when I am creating code. Pre programming was pretty good, my first partner was acting
weird by creating his own code to what we already started but he was fairly new to coding
so its fine. My second partner was cool as well, he has an Associates in IT so he
understood coding very well. I did the work on my own in the first pre lab, but that it
was only because I wanted to learn on my own between python and java. My second partner and
I discussed secontions on what we should work on more than my first,I am fine with that,
and I reviewed the sections with both partners. The problems we faced were very minimal
but we eventually solved them. There are no improvements I would make, labs are fun so far.
